### string特殊性
In Java, C#, JavaScript, Python and Go, strings are immutable. Furthermore, Java, C#, JavaScript and Go have the notion of a constant: a “variable” that cannot be reassigned

In Ruby and PHP, strings are mutable.

The C language does not really have string objects per se. However, we commonly represent strings as a pointer char *. In general, C strings are mutable. The C++ language has its own string class. It is mutable.

In both C and C++, string constants (declared with the const qualifier) are immutable, but you can easily “cast away” the const qualifier, so the immutability is weakly enforced.

In Swift, strings are mutable.
However, if you declare a string to be a constant (keyword let), then it is immutable.
